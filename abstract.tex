The availability of clinical data repositories presents new opportunities for improving health care quality and reducing costs.  However, the secondary function of these data sources as research tools presents challenges for longitudinal data analysis.  Rather than use the sequences directly, we extend the semiparametric clustering framework to build probabilistic models, abstractions, of these sequences using continuous-time Markov models.  This provides a principled way of transforming arbitrarily sampled, irregular length clinical observations to serve as input for a nonparametric Bayesian clustering method. Our results indicate over a 20\% relative improvement on a benchmark and recognizable differences that can be visualized.
