{"name":"ICML 2013 Workshop Submission","tagline":"Semiparametric Clustering Methods for Modeling Chronic Disease Dynamics","body":"Submitted on 4/12/2013\r\n\r\nThe availability of clinical data repositories presents new opportunities for improving \r\nhealth care quality and reducing costs.  However, the secondary function of these data \r\nsources as research tools presents challenges for longitudinal data analysis. Rather\r\nthan use the sequences directly, we extend the semiparametric clustering framework to \r\nbuild probabilistic models, abstractions, of these sequences using continuous-time \r\nMarkov models. This provides a principled way of transforming arbitrarily sampled,\r\nirregular length clinical observations to serve as input for a nonparametric Bayesian \r\nclustering method. Our results indicate over a 20% relative improvement on a benchmark\r\nand recognizable di\u000Berences that can be visualized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
